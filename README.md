# Human-Following-Robot

This is a simple arduino-based robot that uses an arduino UNO, DC motors, ultrasonic sensor, and infrared sensors to follow a human around. It can be developed further by incorporating bluetooth or wifi modules to follow only a particular person. This project was done by referring the following youtube video and the circuit diagram as well as the code were provided by: https://youtu.be/yAV5aZ0unag?si=UKsVSCkqE3C8QyK_
